I started approaching the goal with a count plot of listed shows in each genre to visualize the big picture and only focusing on the 10 most common genres.

The figure simply shows the count number of shows categorized by genres.
As the figure clearly shows that Drama, Comedy and Action are the most common genres on the Netflix platform. Further analysis is yet to be made joining a new attribute which is the viewers average rating from IMDb website.
